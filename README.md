# Ada_RP2040_ELF2UF2
An ELF to UF2 implementation written in Ada for the RP2040 micro-controller.

This tool converts RP2040 ELF files to UF2 format.  

UF2 files are accepted by RP2040 micro-controllers in BOOTSEL mode for FLASH programming.

This is not a universal tool. It is dedicated to the RP2040 micro-controller.  
However, it can easily be hacked to be used for another target.
